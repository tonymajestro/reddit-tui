My dog, Attila, has this magical ability to turn even the worst day around with just a wag of his tail or a goofy little zoomie session.\n\nToday, he:\n\nGreeted me with his favorite toy in his mouth (it‚Äôs a squeaky bear, and he‚Äôs VERY proud of it).\n\nDid his signature \"spin move\" when I asked if he wanted a treat (it‚Äôs like a tiny tornado of happiness).\n\nFell asleep with his head on my lap, snoring softly like a little engine\n\n",

The sun rises and sets with her, and I think I do the same for her.  She sleeps right beside me, I let her out in the morning before I go to work, and I get the 'helicopter' tail when I come home from work.
